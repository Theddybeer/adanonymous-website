    <p> Back on the sofa, you decide to pick another movie ‚Äî perhaps one that won the Palme d‚ÄôOr at the Cannes Film Festival. While searching, you come across Fahrenheit 9/11, a film about the invasion of Iraq following the events of 9/11. You remember that event had a huge impact worldwide and wonder: did its influence on cinema extend beyond this movie and other war-related films?  </p>

# Genre analysis 

{% include_relative assets/figures/9_11/Movies/movie_genre_us_10_23_45.html %} 

You focus on some genre trends around 2001. Shifts can be observed in genres such as social issues, political cinema, law and crime, and culture and society.

Among these, political cinema seems to have an important change . To better understand this shift, you apply a linear regression to analyze the overall trend before and after 2001. Furthermore, you separate the analysis into U.S. and non-U.S. movies to determine whether the change is a global phenomenon or specific to the U.S.

{% include_relative assets/figures/9_11/Movies/regression.html %} 

The analysis shows that, for U.S. movies, the percentage of political cinema is relatively constant before 2001 but shows an upward trend afterward. In contrast, for non-U.S. movies, no significant change in the trend is observed. This suggests that the shift is primarily driven by an event within the U.S. and more probably the 09/11 crisis.

If this shift is linked to the events of 9/11, you want to know whether the trend is consistent for non-U.S. regions. To do so, you focus on three key regions: Europe, Asia, and North America.

![continent_911](/assets/figures/9_11/Movies/9_11_movies_political_cinema_continent.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Starting from 2001, there is a noticeable emergence of the political cinema genre in Asia, where it was previously absent. In Europe, you observe a small increase in the genre's presence, less pronounced than the significant rise seen in North¬†America.
This suggests that while the impact of 9/11 on political cinema is most evident in North¬†America, its influence can also be seen, to a lesser extent, in other regions, particularly in Asia. Some cofounders might also be under the change in the other continents. 







# Movies plot summaries analysis 

You decide to examine the plot summaries of movies, thinking that an event as significant as 9/11 must have influenced their content. But how exactly did it impact the plots ? You set out to compute some interesting statistics to explore this.

First, you analyze the expected number of words before and after 9/11. To ensure meaningful results, you filter out words that appear too infrequently ‚Äî those with an expected frequency of less than 0.001. After some extensive calculations, you identify the top thirty words with the largest ratios of occurrence:


{% include_relative assets/figures/9_11/Plot/9_11_plot_ratio_1e-3.html %} 

Mmmmh, these results don‚Äôt reveal much. You notice the word"[shrek](https://www.francetvinfo.fr/pictures/KI83JKIWxYVA8ng-cUtYxM6l-z8/1200x1200/2016/08/23/shrek-5.jpg)"  , which makes you chuckle.

You decide to refine your analysis further by filtering out words with an expected frequency lower than 0.01. The new results look like this:

{% include_relative assets/figures/9_11/Plot/9_11_plot_ratio_1e-1.html %} 

This time, you notice more general words, though some ‚Äî like "Kim" or "Patrick" ‚Äî remain too still too specific. More relevant terms like "video," "web," and "phone" stand out, reflecting their rise in popularity after the 2000s. Additionally, the word "terrorist" appears with a ratio of about 2, meaning it appears twice as often in plot summaries after 9/11.

Although this provides some interesting insights, the findings are not particularly conclusive. You then decide to plot a scatter graph comparing the expected number of words before and after 9/11, along with a linear regression line.


![9_11_plot_regression](/assets/figures/9_11/Plot/9_11_plot_regression.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

The regression slope is approximately 1.14, suggesting that the expected frequency of words tends to increase slightly over time. This indicates that plot summaries have generally gotten longer, which makes sense but doesn‚Äôt provide much additional insight for this analysis. However, you can use this regression line to identify keywords that are furthest from it. This provides a more accurate comparison of the ratios, accounting for the general trend of increasing plot summary length over time.

{% include_relative assets/figures/9_11/Plot/9_11_plot_furthest_regression.html %} 

You find several words that are not directly related to the topic at hand, except for "**war**."

Rather than analyzing all words, you decide to focus on movies featuring specific keywords. The terms "**plane**," "**tower**," "**terrorism**," "**hijack**," and "**islam**" comes first to mind. You then examine the number of movies containing these keywords.

{% include_relative assets/figures/9_11/Plot/9_11_key_words_occurence_14_18_24.html %} 

Strangely, the word "plane" drops in 2008. The data reveals that the words "**terrorist**" and "**tower**" became more frequent after 2002, showing an increase, though they drop in 2010. The term "**terrorism**" experiences a slight rise after 2001, followed by a decline in 2008. There‚Äôs also a peak in 2006 for "**hijack**," after which its frequency decreases.

However, it seems more insightful to focus on specific time periods. You plot the number of movies before and after 9/11.

{% include_relative assets/figures/9_11/Plot/9_11_plot_percentage_before_after.html %} 

Interestingly, the term "**plane**" is used less frequently after 9/11 than before, despite the expectation that it would appear more often as the aviation industry is in a rising trend. It is surely not linked to 9/11 as you saw in the previous plot that it begins to drop in 2008 : maybe because of climate change ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ? . You see a slight drop for all key words except for "terrorism" and "**islam**". This plot being heavily influenced from the time after 2008, it may have been more insightful to have smaller time periods before and after 9/11. 

In conclusion, analyzing the plot summaries of movies before and after 9/11 reveals some notable shifts in terminology, but the results are not entirely conclusive. While the analysis provides some useful trends, a more refined approach with smaller time periods before and after 9/11 could yield deeper insights.

# Ethnicity analysis

Sitting on your sofa, you now reflect on what you remember about the aftermath of 9/11 after 2001: increase in islamophobia, anti-muslim sentiment, programs such as the surveillance of muslim neighborhoods and mosques becoming more common under national security justifications, etc... You also remember that some non-Muslim populations, particularly the Sikhs, were often mistakenly targeted as Muslims due to their turbans and beards and subjected to violence. For example, the murder of Balbir Singh Sodhi, a Sikh man, in Arizona shortly after 9/11 was a tragic instance of such violence.

You decide to check whether the movie industry was influenced by 9/11. You decide to focus your analysis on the period 1993‚Äì2010, splitting this period into two parts: before and after 9/11. You also know that this event had a far stronger impact on the United States than the rest of the world, so you also separate movies geographically. You first plot the most represented ethnicities in both parts of the world for the entire period 1993‚Äì2010.
![ethnicity_911](/assets/figures/9_11/Ethnicity/plot1.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

You now want to know whether 9/11 had an impact on the distribution of these ethnicities, so you compare the distributions before and after the attack.
![ethnicity_911](/assets/figures/9_11/Ethnicity/9-11_etchnicty_distribution.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Unfortunately, you didn't find any significant difference that could be explained by the attack of 9/11. But you haven‚Äôt had your last word yet! You decide now not to compare the distributions of the most represented ethnicities but rather to display the ethnicities that exhibit the most significant change before and after 9/11.
![ethnicity_911](/assets/figures/9_11/Ethnicity/plot3.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

You look at your results. You note that the Sikh population is in the top five ethnicities that experienced a change before and after 9/11! This is probably no coincidence.

However, in general, the other represented ethnicities do not allow you to establish a clear link with the 9/11 attack. You conclude that 9/11 is not likely to have had a huge impact on the ethnicity distribution in the cinema industry. You feel disappointed but in a way, you feel relieved: islamophobia and discrimination don't seem to have reached the cinema industry!
