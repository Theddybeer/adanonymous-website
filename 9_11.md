title: 9/11
subtitle: How did it impact the movie industry ?
---



Let's go back to the sofa and choose another movie — one that won the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival. While searching, you come across Fahrenheit 9/11, a film about the invasion of Iraq after 9/11. It might be interesting, right? But is it only this movie and other war-related films that were influenced by 9/11 event?

# Genre analysis : US vs rest of the world

{% include_relative assets/figures/9_11/Movies/movie_genre_us_10_23_45.html %} 

If we focus on some genre trends around 2001, shifts can be observed in genres such as social issues, political cinema, law and crime, and culture and society.

Among these, political cinema seems to have an important change . To better understand this shift, we apply a linear regression to analyze the overall trend before and after 2001. Furthermore, we separate the analysis into U.S. and non-U.S. movies to determine whether the change is a global phenomenon or specific to the U.S.

{% include_relative assets/figures/9_11/Movies/regression.html %} 

The analysis shows that, for U.S. movies, the percentage of political cinema is relatively constant before 2001 but shows an upward trend afterward. In contrast, for non-U.S. movies, no significant change in the trend is observed. This suggests that the shift is primarily driven by an event within the U.S. and more probably the 09/11 crisis.

If this shift is linked to the events of 9/11, we want to know whether the trend is consistent for non-U.S. regions. To do so, we focus on three key regions: Europe, Asia, and North America.

![continent_911](/assets/figures/9_11/Movies/9_11_movies_political_cinema_continent.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Starting from 2001, there is a noticeable emergence of the political cinema genre in Asia, where it was previously absent. In Europe, we observe a small increase in the genre's presence, less pronounced than the significant rise seen in the U.S.
This suggests that while the impact of 9/11 on political cinema is most evident in the U.S., its influence can also be seen, to a lesser extent, in other regions, particularly in Asia. Some cofounders might also be under the change in the other continents. 







# Movies plot summaries analysis 

You now look at the plot summaries of the movies. Surely after an event like this, plot summaries of movies have changed. But how ? You try then to compute interesting stuff.

You first try to look at the expected number of words before and after 9/11.
You filter out words that have an expected number of appearences less than 0.001, as they appear way too rarely. After some tedious computing, you obtain the first thirty biggest ratios :

<img src="assets/img/shrek.jpg" alt="drawing" width="200"/>
Mmmmh, we do not see any interesting words, except maybe "[shrek](https://www.francetvinfo.fr/pictures/KI83JKIWxYVA8ng-cUtYxM6l-z8/1200x1200/2016/08/23/shrek-5.jpg)"; it made you chuckle. You try then to to filter more aggressively and take out words that have an expected number of appearences less than 0.01. You obtain this now : 

{% include_relative assets/figures/9_11/Plot/9_11_plot_ratio_1e-1.html %} 

You obtain more general words, altough some are still too specific, as "kim" or "patrick". You see the words "video", "web" and "phone" which makes a lot of sense, as these got more popular after the 2000's. You notice the word "terrorist" with a ratio of ~2, which means it appears twice more often in plot summaries than before.

Okay, that was not very concluant. You try now to fit a scatter plot comparing the expected number of words before and after 9/11 with a linear regression.



![9_11_plot_regression](/assets/figures/9_11/Plot/9_11_plot_regression.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

The slope of the linear regression is ~1.14, suggesting that the expected number of a word tends to grow slighlty. This naively suggests that plot summaries got longer with time and should be ~1.14 longer in expectation, which makes sense but does not help us really here. We can however use this regression line to find interesting key words; you try to find the words that are the furthest from the regression line. This would allow for a more fair analysis for the biggest/smallest ratios, as it "normalizes" the fact that plot summaries got longer with time.

{% include_relative assets/figures/9_11/Plot/9_11_plot_furthest_regression.html %} 

You again find words that are not related to our case at hand, except for the word "war". 

Instead of looking over statistics of all words, you try to focus on movies with certain key words. As key words, "plane", "tower", "terrorism", "hijack" and "islam" come first in your mind. You try to look at the number of movies that contain these key words. 

{% include_relative assets/figures/9_11/Plot/9_11_key_words_occurence_14_18_24.html %} 

We can see that the word "terrorist" and "tower" were more frequent after 2002 and grow, but drops in 2010. The word "terrorism" slightly grows after 2001 but then drops in 2008. There is a peak for the word "hijack" in 2006 and then drops a bit.

Okay but it would make more sense to focus on time periods. You plot the years before and after 9/11. 

{% include_relative assets/figures/9_11/Plot/9_11_plot_percentage_before_after.html %} 

It is interesting to see that for the word "plane", it is less used after 9/11 than before, even though you would expect to have more.
