title: 9/11
subtitle: How did it impact the movie industry ?
---



Let's go back to the sofa and choose another movie — one that won the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival. While searching, you come across Fahrenheit 9/11, a film about the invasion of Iraq after 9/11. It might be interesting, right? But is it only this movie and other war-related films that were influenced by 9/11 event?

# Genre analysis : US vs rest of the world

{% include_relative assets/figures/9_11/Movies/movie_genre_us_10_23_45.html %} 

If we focus on some genre trends around 2001, shifts can be observed in genres such as social issues, political cinema, law and crime, and culture and society.

Among these, political cinema seems to have an important change . To better understand this shift, we apply a linear regression to analyze the overall trend before and after 2001. Furthermore, we separate the analysis into U.S. and non-U.S. movies to determine whether the change is a global phenomenon or specific to the U.S.

{% include_relative assets/figures/9_11/Movies/regression.html %} 

The analysis shows that, for U.S. movies, the percentage of political cinema is relatively constant before 2001 but shows an upward trend afterward. In contrast, for non-U.S. movies, no significant change in the trend is observed. This suggests that the shift is primarily driven by an event within the U.S. and more probably the 09/11 crisis.

If this shift is linked to the events of 9/11, we want to know whether the trend is consistent for non-U.S. regions. To do so, we focus on three key regions: Europe, Asia, and North America.

![continent_911](/assets/figures/9_11/Movies/9_11_movies_political_cinema_continent.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Starting from 2001, there is a noticeable emergence of the political cinema genre in Asia, where it was previously absent. In Europe, we observe a small increase in the genre's presence, less pronounced than the significant rise seen in the U.S.
This suggests that while the impact of 9/11 on political cinema is most evident in the U.S., its influence can also be seen, to a lesser extent, in other regions, particularly in Asia. Some cofounders might also be under the change in the other continents. 







# Movies plot summaries analysis 

You decide to examine the plot summaries of movies, thinking that an event as significant as 9/11 must have influenced their content. But how exactly did it impact the plots ? You set out to compute some interesting statistics to explore this.

First, you analyze the expected number of words before and after 9/11. To ensure meaningful results, you filter out words that appear too infrequently — those with an expected frequency of less than 0.001. After some extensive calculations, you identify the top thirty words with the largest ratios of occurrence:

<img src="assets/img/shrek.jpg" alt="drawing" width="200"/>
MMmmmh, these results don’t reveal much. You notice the word"[shrek](https://www.francetvinfo.fr/pictures/KI83JKIWxYVA8ng-cUtYxM6l-z8/1200x1200/2016/08/23/shrek-5.jpg), which makes you chuckle.

You decide to refine your analysis further by filtering out words with an expected frequency lower than 0.01. The new results look like this:

{% include_relative assets/figures/9_11/Plot/9_11_plot_ratio_1e-1.html %} 

This time, you notice more general words, though some — like "Kim" or "Patrick" — remain too still too specific. More relevant terms like "video," "web," and "phone" stand out, reflecting their rise in popularity after the 2000s. Additionally, the word "terrorist" appears with a ratio of about 2, meaning it appears twice as often in plot summaries after 9/11.

Although this provides some interesting insights, the findings are not particularly conclusive. You then decide to plot a scatter graph comparing the expected number of words before and after 9/11, along with a linear regression line.


![9_11_plot_regression](/assets/figures/9_11/Plot/9_11_plot_regression.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

The regression slope is approximately 1.14, suggesting that the expected frequency of words tends to increase slightly over time. This indicates that plot summaries have generally gotten longer, which makes sense but doesn’t provide much additional insight for this analysis. However, you can use this regression line to identify keywords that are furthest from it. This provides a more accurate comparison of the ratios, accounting for the general trend of increasing plot summary length over time.

{% include_relative assets/figures/9_11/Plot/9_11_plot_furthest_regression.html %} 

You find several words that are not directly related to the topic at hand, except for "war."

Rather than analyzing all words, you decide to focus on movies featuring specific keywords. The terms "plane," "tower," "terrorism," "hijack," and "islam" comes first to mind. You then examine the number of movies containing these keywords.

{% include_relative assets/figures/9_11/Plot/9_11_key_words_occurence_14_18_24.html %} 

Strangely, the word "plane" drops in 2008. The data reveals that the words "terrorist" and "tower" became more frequent after 2002, showing an increase, though they drop in 2010. The term "terrorism" experiences a slight rise after 2001, followed by a decline in 2008. There’s also a peak in 2006 for "hijack," after which its frequency decreases.

However, it seems more insightful to focus on specific time periods. You plot the number of movies before and after 9/11.

{% include_relative assets/figures/9_11/Plot/9_11_plot_percentage_before_after.html %} 

Interestingly, the term "plane" is used less frequently after 9/11 than before, despite the expectation that it would appear more often. It is surely not linked to 9/11 as we saw in the previous plot that it begins to drop in 2008. We see a slight drop for all key words except for "terrorism" and "islam". This plot being heavily influenced from the time after 2008, it may have been more insightful to have smaller time periods before and after 9/11. 

In conclusion, analyzing the plot summaries of movies before and after 9/11 reveals some notable shifts in terminology, but the results are not entirely conclusive. While the analysis provides some useful trends, a more refined approach with smaller time periods before and after 9/11 could yield deeper insights.
